//! Event-driven waits for SCM state transitions via `NotifyServiceStatusChangeW`
//! — a real kernel rendezvous (an APC delivered on the actual state
//! transition, awaited in `SleepEx(INFINITE, TRUE)`), not a poll loop.
//!
//! `windows-service`'s `stop()`/`start()` return as soon as SCM has accepted
//! the request — `StartServiceW` returns once the service's `ServiceMain`
//! thread has been created, not once it reports `SERVICE_RUNNING` — and the
//! crate wraps no wait primitive of its own. The MSDN checkpoint/`dwWaitHint`
//! pattern (`QueryServiceStatusEx` in a `Sleep` loop with a hardcoded bound)
//! is exactly the sleep-poll this project forbids. This module is a
//! near-verbatim port of `~/src/hole/crates/bridge/src/cutover/scm_wait.rs`
//! (translated from the `windows` crate to `windows-sys`, and adapted to
//! reuse `windows-service`'s already-open [`Service`] handle — whose `Drop`
//! already closes the underlying `SC_HANDLE` — instead of managing raw
//! `OpenSCManagerW`/`OpenServiceW` handles by hand): the orchestration below
//! is a pure state machine over [`ScmActor`], unit-tested with a fake in
//! `wait_tests.rs`; [`system::SystemScmActor`] drives the real SCM.
